***Hoisting is a phenomena in javaScript by which we can access all variable and functions before we have initialized it or we can put value on those***

When we try to access variable before intializtion we will get undefined bcz it store undefined when memrory location phase happen. 
If we try to access normal function before inatialization we can, but we can't access arrow function and declerative function, they will behave like variable and we can't invoke a variable.
