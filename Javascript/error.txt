JavaScript Error Types Explained
JavaScript has several built-in error types that help identify issues in your code. Here are explanations of three common error types:

TypeError
A TypeError occurs when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type.

Common causes:

Trying to call something that's not a function
Accessing properties on null or undefined
Using array methods on non-array objects
Example:

SyntaxError
A SyntaxError occurs when the JavaScript parser encounters code that violates the language syntax rules.

Common causes:

Missing closing brackets, braces or parentheses
Invalid variable names
Missing semicolons (in some contexts)
Using reserved keywords incorrectly
Example:

ReferenceError
A ReferenceError occurs when you try to use a variable or function that hasn't been declared or is out of scope.

Common causes:

Using a variable before declaring it
Accessing variables outside their scope
Typos in variable names
Example:

Understanding these error types can help you diagnose and fix problems in your JavaScript code more efficiently.
